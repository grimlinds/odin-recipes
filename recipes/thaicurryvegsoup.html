     <li>While soup is simmering begin to cook your noodles/rice on side in another small pot according to the package directions.</li>
     <li>Once sweet potates are tender, add the coconut milk, fish sauce, and brown sugar to the soup. Stir, taste, and adjust the fish sauce or brown sugar if needed.
